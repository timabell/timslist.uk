## Well hello there, you're early

This isn't ready yet, but you can join my local toy trading group here: [Facebook - Tadley Toys](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tadleytoys)
> Hello, welcome to this new group for Tadley. I'm a local dad of toy-loving kids.  
> Post in here to buy/sell/exchange or give away kids toys. They go through them so fast! Please invite other local mums/dads/carers/grandparents etc to make this a thriving community ðŸ™‚  
> Let's get those toys back into the hands of excited children and keep them out of landfill.  
> Feel free to post links to things you have on other platforms such as marketplace, ebay etc so long as they are still Tadley based.

## What's this going to be?

Initially a super-niche local site for Tadley and surrounding areas to improve the circulation of kids toys.

If that goes well I might expand to clothes, or another town or something. We'll see.

# Who's behind this?

This site is a side-project of [Charm Consulting Ltd.](<https://charmconsulting.co.uk/>)
