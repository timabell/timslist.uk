# Tim's list

A place for buying, selling, exchanging, giving away, recycling, reusing and generally being efficient with our use of stuff.

## Well hello there, you're early

This isn't ready yet, but if you want to start buying and selling now you can join my local toy trading group here: [Facebook - Tadley Toys](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tadleytoys)

If you'd like me to let you know when there's something to use here then probably the best thing to do is [join my general mailing list](https://timwise.co.uk/subscribe/) but do note that that's for everything I do and build not just this site.

## What's this going to be?

Initially a super-niche local site for Tadley and surrounding areas to improve the circulation of kids toys.

If that goes well I might expand to clothes, or another town or something. We'll see.

# Who's behind this?

This site is a side-project of [Charm Consulting Ltd.](<https://charmconsulting.co.uk/>)

# Behind the scenes

## Working in the open

I'll be sharing just about everything as I go. Follow along on [GitHub](https://github.com/timslist) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tim_abell).
